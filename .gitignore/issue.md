Issue Description:

The Chrome extension is designed to display the Atomicmail.io website within an iframe in its popup. While the popup window itself is set to a fixed width (currently 375px in popup.css) intended to mimic a mobile device viewport, the Atomicmail.io content rendered inside the iframe does not consistently or correctly display its mobile-optimized layout. Users have reported that even though the iframe container is narrow, the website within it might still show a desktop or tablet layout, or a layout that isn't fully adapted to the narrow width, leading to a suboptimal user experience (e.g., content being cut off, requiring horizontal scrolling within the iframe, or elements being too small/misaligned for the narrow view).

Suspected Reasons & Areas to Investigate:

Atomicmail.io's Responsive Breakpoints & Detection Mechanism:

Investigate: How does Atomicmail.io determine when to switch to its mobile layout? Does it rely purely on viewport width, or does it also consider user-agent strings, JavaScript-based device detection, or other factors?
Suspect: The site might have specific CSS media query breakpoints (e.g., @media (max-width: Xpx)) that are not being precisely met by our 375px iframe width, or it might prioritize other detection methods that are not fooled by a simple narrow iframe. It's also possible their narrowest layout is designed for a width slightly different from 375px (e.g. 360px, 320px, or uses min-width conditions).
Iframe Limitations & Cross-Origin Policies:

Investigate: Are there any restrictions imposed by the browser or by Atomicmail.io on iframed content that might prevent its responsive CSS or JavaScript from functioning correctly? Check the browser's developer console (when inspecting the popup) for any cross-origin errors or security warnings related to the iframe.
Suspect: While less common for pure CSS responsiveness, if JavaScript is heavily involved in their layout switching, it might behave differently inside an iframe, especially a cross-origin one.
Viewport Meta Tag within Iframe vs. Parent Popup:

Investigate: We've added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> to our popup.html. Confirm that Atomicmail.io itself has an appropriate viewport meta tag. While the parent's viewport tag shouldn't directly control the iframe's content rendering in this way, it's good to ensure both sides are set up for responsiveness. The iframe should respect its own document's viewport settings.
Suspect: This is likely not the primary cause but worth double-checking for completeness. The main focus should be on how Atomicmail.io itself handles responsiveness.
CSS Specificity or !important rules on Atomicmail.io:

Investigate: Using browser developer tools to inspect the elements within the iframe on Atomicmail.io, check if there are any CSS rules (perhaps with high specificity or !important) that are overriding the mobile-specific styles even at narrow widths.
Suspect: The site's desktop styles might be too aggressively applied.
Minimum Width Styles on Atomicmail.io:

Investigate: Does the Atomicmail.io site have a min-width set on its main container or body that prevents it from shrinking below a certain threshold, regardless of the iframe's width?
Suspect: This is a common reason why sites don't become fully fluid below a certain point.
Suggested First Steps for the AI Agent:

Directly Test Atomicmail.io: Open atomicmail.io in a regular browser tab. Use the browser's developer tools to emulate different mobile device widths (especially around 320px, 360px, 375px, 400px). Observe precisely when and how its layout changes. Note the exact CSS media query breakpoints if visible.
Inspect Iframe Content: Load the extension, open the popup, right-click inside the iframe content, and select "Inspect." This will open dev tools scoped to the iframe.
Check the console for errors.
Examine the HTML structure and the CSS being applied to the main layout elements of Atomicmail.io.
See if the <html> or <body> tags of the iframed document have specific classes or styles that indicate a desktop/mobile view.
Experiment with Iframe Width: Modify popup.css in the extension to try slightly different widths for body, html (e.g., 320px, 360px, 414px) to see if any of these trigger the desired mobile layout within the iframe.
By systematically investigating these areas, the agent should be able to pinpoint why the mobile view isn't consistently appearing and then formulate a targeted solution.
